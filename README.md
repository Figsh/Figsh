# Hi there, I'm Ekuyik Sam (Mr Figsh) 👋

### 🚀 The Self-Taught Journey of a Creator
My journey into tech wasn't a straight path—it was a battle. Coming from Akwa Ibom, Nigeria, I started with no mentors, no money, and friends who didn't see the vision. I didn't have AI to guide me; I had old computer textbooks, a stubborn curiosity, and the magic of the "browser."

### 🛠️ The Birth of FSCSS
While others were looking for answers on StackOverflow, I was busy playing with "stupid functions" and mastering **Regex**. I didn't even know what a backend was yet—I just knew I wanted to create something fast and powerful.

That "play" turned into **FSCSS**. I released it to the world on free hosting sites and Facebook, not knowing it would go viral. 
* **The Magic:** Seeing my script mentioned across Google, Quora, and various applications.
* **The Reality:** I didn't know about GitHub or NPM at the time. I was just a guy with a vision, solving problems for other developers before I even knew how to monetize my own.

### 💡 My Philosophy
> "I don't do things to publish my name; I do things to publish my handwork."

I build tools that help beginners and developers scale. Even when my name isn't in the headlines, my code is in the files. I have faced challenges—from hardware issues to being a solo learner—but I will **never give up on tech.**

### 🧰 Technical Toolbox
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (The core of my soul)
* **Frameworks:** FSCSS (Creator), Logic-based CSS architecture
* **Specialties:** Regular Expressions (RegExp), Logic functions, Open Source contribution

### 📈 Current Focus
I am currently looking for opportunities where my "handwork" can bring value to a team. I am a builder who understands the "why" behind the code because I learned it the hard way.
